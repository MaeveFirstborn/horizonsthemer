A python-based wallpaper and theme manager.

CONTEXT:
This is my first application. I've never written a program other than really poorly made unity projects before. This technically started the day I installed Arch for the first time - I wanted to have my wallpapers looping in the background so I decided to script it myself but I didn't know BASH so I wrote it in Python. Then I eventually moved my personal pc to Arch, and this is the continuation of that. As I add more features, including,
## Subreddit scraping
## Palette saving
## Multiple themes
## A systray widget
## A tkinter gui
## A sunrise/sunset trigger
I hope to expand my knowledge of python, Linux app development, the git community, and more.

Thanks
Maeve
